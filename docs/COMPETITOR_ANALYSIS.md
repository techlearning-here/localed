# localed.info — Competitor Analysis

**Purpose:** Map the competitive landscape for a self-service website builder targeting small local businesses (max ~10 pages, subdomain/path hosting, contact + optional appointments).

---

## 1. Competitive landscape overview

Competitors fall into four overlapping buckets:

| Category | Examples | Relevance to localed.info |
|----------|----------|---------------------------|
| **General SMB website builders** | Wix, Squarespace, GoDaddy, Weebly, Hostinger | Full-featured; often overkill and pricier. We compete on simplicity and focus. |
| **Simple / one-page builders** | Carrd, Strikingly | Very simple and cheap; we differentiate with multi-page (up to 10) + local + appointments. |
| **Local / subdomain-focused** | Localo.site, Google Sites, Square (free tier) | Closest to our “simple site on our domain” idea; Localo is GMB-sync, we are custom builder. |
| **Booking-included builders** | Hostinger (booking), SimplyBook.me, Squarespace + Acuity | Combine site + appointments; we can match or integrate. |

---

## 2. Direct and close competitors

### 2.1 Localo / Localo.site

- **What it is:** Free small-business website on `*.localo.site`, auto-generated from **Google Business Profile**.
- **Strengths:** Free, instant publish, strong local SEO (schema, reviews), no technical skills, syncs with GMB.
- **Limitations:** Not a real “builder”—content comes from GMB only; limited to one dynamic site per business; no custom pages or deep customization; no built-in appointment flow (separate tool).
- **Positioning vs localed.info:** They own “no-website → instant GMB-based site.” We own “I want my own pages and content (up to 10) + contact + optional booking on one platform.”

### 2.2 Google Sites

- **What it is:** Free, drag-and-drop sites; can use Google subdomain or custom domain.
- **Strengths:** Free, no ads, simple, integrates with Google Workspace.
- **Limitations:** Generic tool, not local-business-specific; no native appointment booking; no directory or “localed” branding; less template/vertical focus.
- **Positioning vs localed.info:** We focus on local SMB use case, templates by business type, and optional appointments + contact out of the box.

### 2.3 Square (Website Builder)

- **What it is:** Free website builder; free tier on Square subdomain, paid custom domain.
- **Strengths:** Strong for small retail/food; integrates with Square POS and payments.
- **Limitations:** E‑commerce/POS-centric; not positioned as “local presence + appointments first”; custom domain is paid.
- **Positioning vs localed.info:** We are presence + contact + booking first; no requirement to use a specific payment/POS stack.

### 2.4 SimplyBook.me

- **What it is:** Website builder + booking system in one; multi-page, galleries, blog.
- **Strengths:** Booking is core; good for services (classes, workshops, paid/free appointments).
- **Limitations:** Not subdomain-under-one-brand (each site is their own URL); pricing is per-month; more “booking tool with a site” than “local presence with booking.”
- **Positioning vs localed.info:** We can be “localed.info/business” or `business.localed.info` with a clear “local presence” story; we can start simpler and add or integrate booking.

## 3. General small business website builders

| Competitor | Free tier | Subdomain / hosting | Booking / appointments | Typical paid entry | Notes |
|------------|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------|--------|
| **Wix** | Yes (Wix branding, wixsite.com) | Yes (free subdomain) | Via apps/integrations | ~$17+/mo | Full editor, many templates; complex for “just a few pages.” |
| **Squarespace** | No (trial) | Custom domain typical | Built-in scheduling / services | ~$16+/mo | Strong design; good for services + booking; no true free subdomain product. |
| **GoDaddy Website Builder** | Limited | Yes | Add-ons | ~$11+/mo | Fast setup, 200+ templates; simpler feature set. |
| **Weebly** | Yes | Yes | Add-ons | ~$10+/mo | Drag-and-drop, blog, basic eCommerce. |
| **Hostinger** | Promo pricing | Yes | Built-in appointment booking | From ~$3/mo (promo) | Very low cost; AI builder; Google Calendar sync, group sessions; 250+ templates. |

**Takeaway:** incumbents are full-featured and often $10–40/mo. Opportunity for localed.info: **simpler, predictable (e.g. “max 10 pages”), one place for presence + contact + booking, optional free tier on our domain.**

---

## 4. Simple / one-page builders

| Competitor | Model | Page model | Pricing (approx.) | Relevance |
|------------|--------|------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Carrd** | One-page sites | 1 page per site; multiple sites per plan | Free (3 sites); $9–49/year | Ultra-simple, cheap. We differentiate: multi-page (up to 10) per business, local + appointments. |
| **Strikingly** | One-page focus | Single-page emphasis | Free; $8–20/mo | Similar to Carrd; we offer more structure (multiple pages) and local SMB focus. |

**Takeaway:** localed.info is not “one beautiful landing page” but “small multi-page site (≤10 pages) for a local business with contact and optional booking”—clear differentiation.

---

## 5. Booking-included or booking-first

| Competitor | Site builder | Booking | Pricing (approx.) | Notes |
|------------|--------------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| **Hostinger** | Yes (templates, AI) | Yes (slots, calendar, group sessions) | From ~$2.99/mo (promo) | Strong on price; not “localed” branded or directory. |
| **Squarespace** | Yes | Native scheduling / services | ~$16+/mo | Premium positioning. |
| **Acuity Scheduling** | Optional simple site or embed | Core product | Subscription | Often used with Squarespace/Wix; we could integrate later. |
| **SimplyBook.me** | Yes (multi-page) | Core | Subscription + trial | “Booking + site”; we can be “site + optional booking” on localed.info. |

**Takeaway:** We don’t have to build the most advanced booking engine in v1; “simple slots + notifications” or a single integration (e.g. Cal.com/Calendly) can be enough to match local SMB needs.

## 6. Summary comparison (positioning)

| Dimension | Localo | Wix / Squarespace / GoDaddy | Carrd / Strikingly | localed.info (proposed) |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| **Primary audience** | Local SMB (GMB-linked) | Broad SMB / creatives | One-page / personal | Local SMB (any) |
| **Page limit** | Effectively 1 (GMB-driven) | Unlimited / high | 1 per site | **Max 10** (clear, predictable) |
| **Hosting** | *.localo.site | Custom or builder subdomain | Custom or Carrd subdomain | ***.localed.info or /path** |
| **Content source** | GMB sync | User-built | User-built | **User-built, template-led** |
| **Contact** | Yes | Yes | Yes | **Yes (forms, hours, map)** |
| **Appointments** | Separate | Add-on / native (varies) | External | **Optional built-in or integrate** |
| **Discovery / directory** | No | No | No | **Optional (future)** |
| **Free tier** | Yes | Yes (Wix, Weebly) or no | Yes (Carrd) | **TBD (e.g. 3 pages free)** |

---

## 7. Gaps and opportunities (for localed.info)

1. **“Up to 10 pages” as a product:** Most alternatives are either one-page (Carrd, Localo) or unlimited (Wix, etc.). A clear, small multi-page cap is easy to explain and to implement.
2. **One brand, many businesses:** Publishing under localed.info (subdomain or path) positions us as a **place for local businesses** and enables a future directory without building a separate product.
3. **Local-first, not GMB-dependent:** Localo depends on Google Business Profile. We can serve businesses that don’t use GMB or want a site that they fully control.
4. **Simplicity vs giants:** Wix/Squarespace are powerful but heavy. We can target “I need a small, professional site + contact + maybe booking” with fewer choices and lower cognitive load.
5. **Pricing wedge:** Between free (Localo, Carrd free, Wix free) and $10–40/mo (Wix, Squarespace, GoDaddy), there is room for a **low-cost or freemium** offer (e.g. 3 pages free, 10 pages + booking paid).
6. **Appointments:** Not all local builders bundle booking; we can make “contact + optional booking” a first-class combo from day one (or via one integration).

---

## 8. Risks and considerations

- **Localo:** If small businesses are happy with “GMB-only” sites, they may not look for a custom builder. We need a clear story: “Want your own pages and branding? Use localed.info.”
- **Hostinger:** Very low price and built-in booking; we compete on **positioning** (local, 10-page limit, directory potential) and **UX** (simpler, local-SMB flows).
- **Free tiers (Wix, Carrd, Localo):** We need a compelling reason to choose localed.info (e.g. multi-page, local discovery, one dashboard for presence + contact + booking).

---

## 9. Implications and next steps

- **Positioning:** “Simple multi-page website (up to 10 pages) for your local business, on localed.info—contact, hours, map, and optional appointments.”
- **MVP:** Consider 3–5 pages + contact + one template first; add appointments in v1 (simple slots) or via Cal.com/Calendly.
- **Pricing:** Define freemium (e.g. 3 pages, localed.info branding) vs paid (10 pages, optional custom subdomain, booking).
- **Differentiation in messaging:** Emphasize “max 10 pages” (simplicity), “on localed.info” (one place for local businesses), and “contact + appointments” in one product.
