# localed.info — Pricing Options

**Purpose:** Propose a pricing range that undercuts Localo and captures price-sensitive small local businesses, while staying viable for localed.info.

---

## Chosen pricing: **$4/mo**

| Tier | Price | What’s included |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **Free** | $0 | Up to 3 pages, contact, map, hours; localed.info branding; **English only** |
| **Paid** | **$4/mo** (or **$39/year** ≈ $3.25/mo) | Up to 10 pages, contact, map, hours, **appointments**; optional branding removal; **English included** |

**Multi-language add-on:** Any language **other than English** adds an **additional cost** (see [Additional languages](#additional-languages-add-on) below). Languages are selected during site setup; see [SITE_BUILDER_UX.md](./SITE_BUILDER_UX.md).

Positioning: lowest-cost option to maximize signups; directory/discovery upside later.

### Additional languages (add-on)

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| English | **Included** (base) |
| Additional languages (any selection other than English) | **Flat add-on** — +$X/mo (TBD) for multi-language, regardless of how many extra languages |

One flat fee unlocks all additional languages the owner selects during setup. Add-on applies to paid tier (and optionally to free if we allow multi-language on free later).

### Subdomain (add-on)

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| **Default** | **Path-based** URL: `localed.info/your-business` (included) |
| **Subdomain** | **Add-on** — +$X/mo (TBD) for `your-business.localed.info` |

When the add-on is enabled, the site is available at **both** `localed.info/your-business` and `your-business.localed.info` (same content). Appeals to businesses that want the “business name first” URL for branding. Requires wildcard DNS and host-based routing (see [SUBDOMAIN_VS_PATH.md](./SUBDOMAIN_VS_PATH.md)). Add-on available on paid tier only.

## 1. What Localo actually charges

[Localo](https://localo.com/) is a **full local SEO platform**, not just a website builder. Their pricing (from [Localo pricing](https://localo.com/pricing)):

| Plan | Monthly | Annual (≈40% off) | What you get |
|------|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Single Business** | $49/mo | **$39/mo** (billed yearly) | 1 Google Business Profile; tracking, audit, protection, content publisher, review manager, reports, **website builder**, citations, smart tasks, AI agent, etc. |
| **Pro** | $169/mo | $149/mo | Up to 60 profiles (optimize 30); agency features. |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | — | High volume. |

So the **$39/month** you see is the **annual** price for the **entire** Localo suite (rank tracking, audits, reviews, content, citations, reports, *and* the GMB-based website). The standalone “website” from Localo is also available for free on `*.localo.site` (no custom pages, GMB-only content).

**Takeaway:** We’re not competing with the full Localo stack. We’re competing for “I just want a simple multi-page site + contact + booking.” Many small businesses won’t pay $39–49/mo for full SEO tools; they will pay much less for “a proper small website.”

## 2. Competitor price anchors (website + presence)

| Competitor | Free tier | Paid entry (approx.) | Notes |
|------------|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| **Localo (full platform)** | Free *.localo.site site (GMB-only) | **$39–49/mo** (full SEO suite) | Website is one feature. |
| **Wix** | Yes (branded subdomain) | ~$17+/mo | Full builder. |
| **Squarespace** | Trial only | ~$16+/mo | Design + scheduling. |
| **GoDaddy** | Limited | ~$11+/mo | Simple builder. |
| **Weebly** | Yes | ~$10+/mo | Drag-and-drop. |
| **Hostinger** | Promo | From ~$3/mo (promo) | Builder + booking. |
| **Carrd** | 3 sites free | $9–49/**year** | One-page only. |

So “website for small business” typically sits in **$0 (free with limits) to ~$17/mo**. Localo’s $39/mo is for the **SEO product**, not for “just a website.”

## 3. Recommended pricing range for localed.info

**Goal:** Capture customers who want “simple web presence + contact + optional booking” and find Localo (full suite) or Wix/Squarespace too expensive or too heavy.

### Option A — Aggressive capture (recommended)

| Tier | Price | Pages | Contact / map / hours | Appointments | Branding |
|------|--------|-------|------------------------|--------------|----------|
| **Free** | **$0** | Up to 3 | Yes | No | “Made with localed.info” or small badge |
| **Starter** | **$6/mo** or **$5/mo** (annual) | Up to 10 | Yes | Yes (basic slots) | Optional removal of badge / cleaner footer |
| **Pro** (later) | **$12/mo** or **$9/mo** (annual) | Up to 10 | Yes | Yes + calendar sync, reminders | No localed branding; priority support |

- **Free:** Enough to try the product and get a real site (3 pages, contact, map, hours). Good for adoption and word-of-mouth.
- **Starter at $5–6/mo:** Clear step up from free; **well below** Localo’s $39/mo and below Wix/GoDaddy (~$11–17). Easy to say: “Less than a coffee per week.”
- **Pro:** For businesses that want “no branding” and better booking; still far below $39/mo.

**Annual discount:** Offer ~20–25% off for yearly payment (e.g. $60/year ≈ $5/mo) to improve cash flow and retention.

### Option B — Simpler two-tier

| Tier | Price | What’s included |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 3 pages, contact, map, hours; localed.info branding |
| **Full** | **$8/mo** ($6/mo annual) | 10 pages, contact, map, hours, appointments; optional branding removal |

Single upgrade path; messaging: “Full site + booking for $8/mo.”

### Option C — Ultra-low (maximize volume) ✅ chosen

| Tier | Price |
|------|--------|
| **Free** | 3 pages, contact; branding |
| **Paid** | **$4/mo** or **$39/year** (~$3.25/mo) — 10 pages + appointments |

Positions localed.info as the **lowest-cost** option; margin is thin, optimized for user count and directory/discovery upside later.

## 4. Why this captures customers vs Localo

| Angle | Localo | localed.info (proposed) |
|--------|--------|---------------------------|
| **Price** | $39–49/mo (full SEO) | **$0 or $4/mo** for site + contact + booking |
| **Use case** | “I want full local SEO + a site” | “I just want a small website + contact + booking” |
| **Commitment** | High (SEO platform) | Low (focused product) |
| **Message** | “All-in-one local SEO” | “Your small business site, done in minutes, for a few dollars a month” |

Many small businesses don’t need rank tracking, audits, or review tools yet—they need **a proper-looking site and a way to get contacted or booked**. For that, **$39/mo is hard to justify**; **$5–8/mo is an easy yes.**

---

## 5. Suggested positioning line

- **vs Localo:** “Localo gives you a full SEO suite for $39/mo. We give you a real multi-page website with contact and booking for **$4/mo**—or start free.”
- **vs Wix/Squarespace:** “No complexity. Up to 10 pages, contact, and appointments. **From $0.**”

---

## 6. Summary recommendation

- **Free tier:** 3 pages, contact, map, hours; localed.info branding.
- **Paid tier:** **$4/mo** (or **$39/year** ≈ $3.25/mo) for 10 pages + appointments + optional branding removal.
- **Result:** Strongly undercuts Localo’s $39/mo and typical website builders ($10–17/mo); maximum appeal for price-sensitive local businesses.
