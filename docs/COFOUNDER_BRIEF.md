# localed.info 


## What is localed.info?

**localed.info** is a simple way for small local businesses to get a real website. They pick their business type, choose a ready-made template, fill in their details (name, contact, hours, photos, etc.), and publish. The site goes live at an address like **yourbusiness.localed.info** (or localed.info/yourbusiness). No coding, no hiring a developer — they can do it themselves and come back anytime to edit.

---

## Who is it for?

- **Salons, clinics, repair shops, tutors, cafes, restaurants, local services** — any small business that wants an online presence but doesn’t need a big, complex website.
- They want: **contact info, location/map, business hours, and (optionally) appointment booking** in one place. Many have no website today, or only a single Google listing.

---

## What do we offer?

| What | In plain language |
|------|-------------------|
| **Simple website** | Up to 10 pages (e.g. Home, About, Services, Contact). They don’t build from scratch — they pick a template that fits their business and edit the text and images. |
| **Contact & location** | Contact form, phone, email, address, and a map so customers can find them. |
| **Business hours** | Set opening hours; the site can show “Open now” or “Closed.” |
| **Multi-language** | They can offer the site in more than one language (e.g. English + Hindi). English is included; extra languages are a small add-on. |
| **Appointments (paid)** | Optional booking so customers can book a time slot on the site. We can plug in a tool like Cal.com or Calendly so we don’t build the whole booking engine ourselves. |
| **QR code** | They can download a QR code that links to their site — for the shop window, flyers, or local ads. |
| **Edit anytime** | They can log in later and change anything; updates go live when they click “Publish” again. |

We keep the builder **very simple**: choose business type → get a template → edit the content → preview → publish. No drag-and-drop from scratch.

### More we can offer (high perceived value)

We can add these to strengthen the offer and reduce friction:

| Idea | In plain language |
|------|-------------------|
| **Hyper-local SEO assistance** | We automatically add **meta tags**, **Google Map embedding**, and **structured data (Schema.org)** tailored to each business type. That helps their site rank in local search — **huge perceived value** (“we help you get found”). |
| **AI-powered copy or translation** | We **auto-generate** basic site text (intro, service descriptions) or **translations** (e.g. English → Hindi). They can edit after. Removes the “what do I write?” or “I need this in another language” block. |
| **“Instant Google visibility” button** | One-click (or simple flow) to **publish their site link to Google Business Profile** or to **get the site indexed quickly** by Google. Strong “get found” story for non-technical owners. |
| **QR + print bundle** | Option to **order a printed sticker or mini-standee** with their QR code — we or a partner ship it. They can put it in the shop window or on the counter for **offline promotion** without printing themselves. |

These can come in v1.1 or v2; they’re called out because they add strong perceived value and differentiation.

## Pricing (chosen)

| Tier | Price | What they get |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Free** | $0 | Up to 3 pages, contact, map, hours. Our branding on the site. English only. |
| **Paid** | **$4/month** (or **$39/year**) | Up to 10 pages, contact, map, hours, **appointments**, option to remove our branding. English included. |
| **Extra languages** | Small flat add-on (amount TBD) | Any language other than English. One fee for all extra languages they choose. |
| **Subdomain** | Add-on (amount TBD) | Optional **yourbusiness.localed.info** in addition to localed.info/yourbusiness — “business name first” URL. |

**Why $4?** We undercut competitors (e.g. Localo’s full product at $39/mo, Wix/GoDaddy around $10–17/mo) and make it an easy “yes” for a real website. Free tier gets people in; paid tier is for those who want more pages and booking.

---

## Why would they choose us?

- **Easiest and cheapest** for “I just need a small, professional site with contact and maybe booking.”
- **No lock-in** — they can edit whenever they want; we’re not a full SEO suite or a heavy website builder.
- **One place** — site + contact + map + hours + optional booking + QR code, without juggling multiple tools.
- **Future:** We can add a **directory** on localed.info (e.g. “Find a salon near you”) so customers discover businesses and visit their sites — more value for our users and more traffic for us.
- **High-value extras (v1.1 / v2):** Hyper-local SEO (auto meta tags, map, Schema.org), AI-generated copy or translations, “Instant Google visibility” (publish to Google Business Profile / get indexed), and QR + print bundle (sticker or standee shipped to them) — all add strong perceived value and help them get found.

## Can we add customers and make money?

**Yes, but** the main challenge is **getting in front of enough small businesses**. The product is clear and differentiated; the bottleneck is distribution.

- **Revenue:** At $4/mo we need a good number of paying customers for meaningful revenue (e.g. 250 paid ≈ $1k/month before add-ons). With add-ons (multi-language, later “featured” in directory) we can grow revenue per customer. It can be a **real business** if we find a repeatable way to acquire users and keep churn low.
- **Risks:** Many small businesses don’t search for “website builder”; they rely on word of mouth or one channel (Google, Facebook, a local partner). Free options (e.g. Localo’s free site, Wix free) exist — we need a clear reason they choose us (simplicity, price, “real” multi-page site + booking). New brand means we have to build trust (“Who’s localed.info? Is my site safe?”).

**What needs to go right:** (1) One or two channels that bring signups (e.g. SEO, a partner like a chamber of commerce, or paid ads). (2) A good share of free users upgrading to paid when they need more pages or booking. (3) Low churn — they keep the site because it’s useful (contact form, visits, bookings). (4) We stay focused: simple product, no feature creep.

## What we’re not (and don’t need to be)

- **Not** a full “build anything” website builder (like Wix).
- **Not** a full local SEO platform (like Localo’s $39/mo suite).
- **Not** a custom-domain-first product in v1 — all sites live on localed.info; we can add “bring your own domain” later.

We’re the **simple, cheap, local-business site** — contact, map, hours, optional booking, QR code — in one place.

## Suggested next steps for the team

1. **Align on the idea** — Do we all agree on: simple site builder for local businesses, free + $4/mo, template-based, optional booking and QR?
2. **Define MVP** — What’s the smallest set of features we need to launch? (e.g. one template, 3–5 pages, contact form, one business type to start.)
3. **Distribution** — How will we get the first 50–100 signups? (One geography? One partner? SEO? Paid test?)
4. **Roles** — Who owns product, who owns growth/sales, who owns support?
