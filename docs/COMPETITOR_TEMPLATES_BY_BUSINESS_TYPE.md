## How to use this doc

- **Template picker:** When adding a third or fourth template per type, consider industry-specific labels (e.g. “Salon – Modern” or “Barber”) if we want to match competitor naming.
- **Content plan & seed copy:** Ensure `lib/content-plan.ts` and `lib/seed-content.ts` use terminology that aligns with these names (e.g. “services” for salon, “treatments” for clinic where appropriate).
- **PRE_CREATED_TEMPLATES_AND_CONTENT.md:** When we add “many templates per type”, we can name variants using the competitor-style names above (e.g. “Beauty Salon”, “Barber”, “Day Spa” under `salon`).
- **TEMPLATES_GOOD_AS_COMPETITORS.md:** Phase 4 “more templates per business type” can reference this list for naming and positioning.
